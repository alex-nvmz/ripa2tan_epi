# Missing data

Most environmental data is available (2014-2022).

Population for 2022 was not available, so it was linearly interpolated.

Greenness has a few missing observations at different months for Moshi and Siha.

The rest of environmental variables are available until 2021 (inclusive), except for rain in Siha.
